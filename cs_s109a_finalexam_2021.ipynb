    "\n",
    "**1.1** Load the data sets as follows:\n",
    "- 'covid_cases_county.csv' as `covid_raw` \n",
    "- 'vaccines_county.csv' as `vaccines_raw`\n",
    "- 'masks_county.csv' as `masks`\n",
    "- 'demographics_county.csv' as `demo` \n",
    "\n",
    "**1.2** Create a subset of the `covid_raw` data frame that only contains the measures for 5 dates: June 27 and July 4, 11, 18 and 25.  Do the same for the `vaccines_raw`.  Call these subsets `covid` and `vaccines`, respectively, and print out their dimensions (aka, shapes).\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.3** Determine and print the number of counties that are measured for each time period in `covid` and `vaccines` (do not print out the list of counties, just the number/count).  Comment on what this implies for presence of missing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.4** Process both `covid` and `vaccines` so that each county is represented by a single row in each data frame (rather than having 5 separate rows for each county: 1 for each time period in part 1.2).  Call these new generate Pandas data frames `covid_by_county` and `vaccines_by_county` separately.  Print out the dimensions of each resulting data frame, and view the header of `covid_by_county`.  Note: you should use informative names for the columns in the resulting data frames: for example, `cases_w30` for the cumulative number of cases on July 25 (it's the 30th week of the calendar year).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint**: Splitting based on dates and then using `pd.DataFrame.merge` (source)[https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.merge.html] could be helpful for this task using the `fips` code as the keys to join on (you should drop any counties that are not measured in all time periods...the default argument for `how` in `pd.DataFrame.merge` will behave this way).\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.5** Merge the 4 data fames (`covid_by_county`, `vaccines_by_county`, `masks`, and `demo`) based on `fips` and save the result as `covid_merged` (you should drop any counties that are not measured in all 4 data frames).  Determine and report how many counties were dropped from `demo` in this process, and view the header of `covid_merged`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.6** Use `covid_merged` to calculate the novel case rate (per 1000 residents) for each of the weeks for all of the counties, and save these as 4 new well-named variables in `covid_merged`.  For example, `rate_w30` can mathematically be represented as `1000*(cases_30-cases_29)/population`.  Plot the histogram of the novel case rate in week 29, `rate_w29`, and comment on what you notice.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.7** We did the steps above (and some other minimal processing) and saved the results in `covid_clean.csv` for you.  Use this data file to answer some exploratory questions and all future analyses: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Has the overall average case rate increased from week 28 (July 5-11) to week 29 (July 12-18)?  \n",
    "2. Treating the counties as separate and equal observations: in what states did the case rate increase the most?  In what states did the case rate decrease the most (or increse the least)?  List the top 5 for each.  Do you notice any patterns in these states?\n",
    "3. Create and interpret separate visuals to display how the country case rate in week 29 relates to each of the following variables. Interpret what you see (be specific to this domain).\n",
    "\n",
    "    a. The political views in the county (as measured by the votergap in the 2020 election).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    b. The vaccination rate in the county (for week 28) (be sure to throw away the zeros as these represent unreported values).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    c. The population density of the county.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    d. Whether 50% or more of the surveyed residents in the county report that they always wore a mask in public at the time of the survey."

    "The vaccines set has 3224 counties while covid has 3218.\n",
    "This is because the data sets are also including counties in Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands, Northern Mariana and Guam. If you were to only count the 50 states of US you would get 3218-83= 3135 counties for the covid set and 3224-82= 3142 counties in the vaccines set. The number for the vaccines set is almost the same as wikipedias number of counties for the 50 states of US (3143 in 2020), while the covid set is missing 7 more counties. Three of the missing counties have the state column filled, and can be identified as York City, Cansas City and Joplin. These should be added in if we want to use this for prediction or EDA, especially New York City because of its large population. However, I am not doing that here, because the task is not asking for cleaning of the data."

    "##### Answer Q1.7.3 a:\n",
    "The plot of rates needs to be seen in relation to the histogram showing the density of counties for the different values of votergap20. This is because a higher density leads to a higher probability of getting one county for that value of votergap that is high enough for us to visually interpret this different from other readings in the bar plot.   \n",
    "Since there is a higher density on the trump side of votergap20 we also need to be careful with interpreting the values in this area. A more fair comparison is comparing the values between votergap20: (-90)-(-75) with votergap20: 25-45, since these have a more similar amount of counties. When comparing these ranges we see that there is not a clear \"winner\", but the Biden side (25-45) seems to generally have lower rates, but with sporadic higher values that are on the same level as the compared Trump side."

    "##### Answer Q1.7.3 b:\n",
    "From a first glance at the plots to the left we see high covid rates (above 5 per 1000) only for counties where vaccination rates are below 50% both when looking at dose 1 and fully vaccinated (not counting the faulty 99.9% vaccination from Chattahoochee).   \n",
    "When we start digging deeper we need to remember that this bar plot will also have a higher chance of showing a high bar when there are more counties plotted at one range of vaccines (e.g. around 35% vaccinations there are much more occurrances than at 70+). However, on the histogram we can see a resemblence of normal distribution around 35 for 'fully' and 40 for 'dose1' (with a larger left tail on both). A good approach can be to interpret the difference on both sides of these means.    \n",
    "With this in mind we see higher covid rates in the area to the left of each mean, than to the right, showing that the observed values of covid rates was higher for counties that has lower vaccination.   \n",
    "Lastly we also need to remember that even though there is (probably) a causal relationship here, that cannot be determined without experimental testing. Theoretically these differences could be due to people in states with vaccinations are generally better at following rules than in states where it is not vaccinated as much, or similar."
